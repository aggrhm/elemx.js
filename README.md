# ElemX.js

**ElemX** is a proof-of-concept library for connecting Mobx to native Web Components with a Vue-like template binding syntax.

## Why?

Yes, this is another front-end javascript framework, so why write it?

- I like the potential of native [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
- I prefer using [MobX](https://mobx.js.org) for state management
- I like the template binding syntax of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html) and [Knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)

## Example Code

[Hello World]() - A must have
[Todo List]() - Also incorporates [weightless](https://weightless.dev)

## Attribute Bindings

## Enhanced Bindings

## Custom Bindings
